            <h3>About Our Fines & Fees</h3>
        </div>
            <p>Library customers borrow over 13,000,000 items per year from the Orange County Library System. In striving to assure that the greatest variety of materials are available for Library users, we have found that fines are an effective encouragement for prompt return of materials. We also apply certain fees that encourage appropriate use of our materials so that once returned the items may be borrowed by others without delay.<br><br>

                We understand that due to a wide variety of circumstances such as illness or other unanticipated demands in our personal lives, materials are sometimes returned late. However, we do not attempt to judge any individual's circumstances as more excusable than another's. The impact of late returns is the same in all cases regardless of the cause. We do not provide exceptions based on cause.<br><br>
                
                As custodians of both the collection and the public's trust, the Library is committed to fair and consistent application of our policies. Holding all users equally accountable for the use of the Library and any fees or fines incurred is part of meeting that public obligation.<br><br>
                
                The Library works to encourage our borrowers to avoid the charging of fines and fees. We provide notices to help educate and inform borrowers regarding the use of their account. To learn more about how you can avoid fines please read more below.</p>

        <div class="flex">
            <p class="left">We provide many opportunities for you to avoid the accrual of fines on your library account. Alachua County Library District System materials may be returned to any Alachua County Library District System location, regardless of where they were checked out. You may request a check in receipt at any location when you return an item to the service desk or staffed drive up window.<br><br>
                <b>We offer 3 ways for you to renew your eligible material:</b>
                <br>
                You may renew online by logging into your library card account

                <div class="col-square">
            <p class="text-center">Add your email address to your account and you will receive a courtesy notice*:<br>
                When an item is due in 3 days <br>
                On the day an item is due
                <br><br>
                * Please note that these are courtesy notices. Failure of the notice to be delivered by your email supplier does not excuse fines.
                <br><br>
                
                An overdue notice is emailed once an item is 14 days past due. If you do not have an email address on your account, the overdue notice will be mailed. Once an item is 28 days past due, it is assumed lost. A bill will be mailed, and your account will be assessed the cost of the lost item plus a $5 non-refundable handling fee.</p>
